# Fetch repo tool

This tool is copied from [Gazelle](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/tree/5c00b77/cmd/fetch_repo) and is used for downloading go module packages.
In the long run it could be a replacement for the current `go_get` rule, providing a similar set of features as [go_repository](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle/blob/5c00b77/repository.rst#go_repository).
